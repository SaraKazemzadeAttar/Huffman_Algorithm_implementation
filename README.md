# Huffman Encoding Animation with Python and Tkinter

This project implements a **Huffman Encoding** algorithm and visualizes the construction of the Huffman tree using **Python**, **Tkinter**, **NetworkX**, and **Matplotlib**. The application also includes an optional feature to switch the left and right child nodes in the Huffman tree construction.

## Overview
Huffman coding is a lossless data compression algorithm where the frequency of each character determines its binary encoding. This project animates the step-by-step construction of the Huffman tree and shows the Huffman codes for a given string.

## Features
- Visualization of Huffman tree construction.
- Customizable input of any string or sentence.
- Optional left-child switching during Huffman tree construction.
- Animated representation of the merging process in the tree.
- Error handling for invalid input.
  
## Installation
### Prerequisites
You will need the following installed on your system:
- **Python 3.6+**
- **Tkinter** (for GUI)
- **Matplotlib** (for animations)
- **NetworkX** (for graph representation)
### Install Dependencies
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/huffman-encoding-animation.git
   cd huffman-encoding-animation
   pip install matplotlib pillow networkx
    ```
